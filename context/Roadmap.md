📊 Project Scope Overview
-------------------------

**What You're Building:**

-   4-page React DApp that interacts with your factory + campaign contracts
-   Wallet connection (MetaMask)
-   Full read/write contract interactions
-   Campaign creation → Token approval → Contribution → Withdrawal/Refund flow

**Technology Stack (Modern & Job-Ready):**

-   **Smart Contracts:** Solidity 0.8.18, OpenZeppelin, Hardhat
-   **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite, React Router v6
-   **Web3:** ethers.js v6 + wagmi + RainbowKit
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
-   **Network:** Sepolia testnet

**Timeline:** 8-12 weeks (2-3 hours/day, 4-5 days/week)

* * * * *

🚀 Phase 1: Smart Contract Deployment & Manual Testing
------------------------------------------------------

**Duration:** 1.5-2 weeks\
**Goal:** Deploy your contracts to Sepolia and experience the full flow manually

### What You'll Learn

-   Hardhat project structure
-   Deployment scripts
-   Testnet interaction
-   **The token approval problem** (you'll feel the pain before building the solution!)

### Steps to Complete

#### Step 1.1: Environment Setup

**Tasks:**

1.  Install Hardhat in a new `contracts/` folder
2.  Set up project structure (contracts/, scripts/, test/)
3.  Copy your Factory and Master contract code
4.  Install OpenZeppelin contracts
5.  Configure `hardhat.config.js` for Sepolia

**Research Topics:**

-   Hardhat vs Foundry (understand the difference)

-   Hardhat networks configuration
-   Alchemy or Infura RPC providers

**Deliverables to Review with Me:**

-   Working Hardhat project that compiles
-   Sepolia configuration ready
-   Screenshots of successful compilation

* * * * *

#### Step 1.2: Deploy a Test ERC20 Token

**Why:** Your campaigns need reward tokens. You need your own test token to approve.

**Tasks:**

1.  Create a simple ERC20 token contract (use OpenZeppelin template)
2.  Write deployment script for this token
3.  Deploy to Sepolia
4.  Mint yourself 1,000,000 tokens
5.  Verify contract on Etherscan

**Research Topics:**

-   ERC20 token standard
-   OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation
-   Hardhat deployment scripts
-   Etherscan verification

**Deliverables:**

-   Deployed token address
-   Etherscan link showing your token balance
-   Explanation: What does `decimals` mean in ERC20?

* * * * *

#### Step 1.3: Deploy Factory & Create First Campaign

**Tasks:**

1.  Write deployment script for Factory
2.  Deploy Factory to Sepolia
3.  Using Etherscan's "Write Contract" interface:
    -   Call `createClone(...)` with your test token
    -   Get the new campaign address from the event
4.  Add the campaign address to MetaMask as a watchlist

**Research Topics:**

-   EIP-1167 Minimal Proxy (why your Factory uses Clones)
-   Gas costs: clone vs full deployment
-   How to read event logs on Etherscan

**Deliverables:**

-   Factory contract address
-   First campaign address
-   Answers: Why use a factory? What's a proxy clone?

* * * * *

#### Step 1.4: Manual Testing - The Full Flow

**This is CRITICAL for understanding the UX challenges.**

**Tasks (Do in Order):**

1.  **Approve Tokens:**

    -   Go to your ERC20 token on Etherscan
    -   Call `approve(campaignAddress, 10000e18)`
    -   *Why we do this:* Understand this BEFORE building UI!
2.  **Contribute:**

    -   Send 0.01 ETH to campaign via `contribute()`
    -   Check the `Contributed` event
    -   Verify you received reward tokens
3.  **Try to Contribute Without Approval:**

    -   Create a second campaign
    -   Try to contribute WITHOUT approving first
    -   **Observe the transaction revert**
    -   This teaches why the UI must guide users!
4.  **Test Deadline & Finalize:**

    -   Wait for deadline OR create a campaign with 5-minute duration
    -   Call `finalize()`
    -   Observe state change
5.  **Withdraw (if successful):**

    -   Call `withdraw()` as creator
    -   Check your ETH balance increased
6.  **Refund (create a failed campaign):**

    -   Create campaign with high goal
    -   Contribute small amount
    -   Wait for deadline
    -   Finalize
    -   Call `refund()`

**Research Topics:**

-   Solidity `payable` functions
-   `transferFrom` vs `transfer` for ERC20
-   Why `finalize()` is needed (state transitions)

**Deliverables to Review:**

-   Screenshots/transaction hashes for each step
-   Written answer: "Why does contribute() fail if the Factory admin hasn't approved tokens?"
-   Written answer: "Why does the Factory admin need to approve, not the campaign creator?"
-   A description of one problem you encountered and how you debugged it

**Questions to Reflect On (We'll Discuss):**

-   What was confusing about the token approval step?
-   How would you explain the Factory admin role to a non-technical user?
-   What's the difference between Factory admin approval vs campaign creator approval?
-   What UI warnings would help users understand this flow?

* * * * *

* * * * *

#### Step 2.3: Build Static Campaign Card Component

**Tasks:**

1.  Create `CampaignCard` component that displays (with mock data):
    -   Campaign address (shortened: `0x1234...5678`)
    -   Creator address (shortened)
    -   Goal (e.g., "5 ETH")
    -   Deadline (formatted: "Jan 20, 2026, 3:45 PM")
    -   Progress bar (totalRaised / goal)

2.  Add a "View Details" button that links to `/campaign/:address`
3.  Style it nicely with Tailwind
4.  Use multiple cards on `HomePage` with different mock data

**Research Topics:**

-   Tailwind flexbox/grid
-   Progress bars (can use `shadcn/ui` Progress component)
-   Date formatting with `date-fns`
-   Address formatting (create a utility: `shortenAddress()`)

**Deliverables:**

**Deliverables:**

-   Working form with validation
-   Screenshot showing error messages
-   Question: Why validate on frontend if the contract will validate too?

* * * * *

#### Step 2.5: Build Campaign Detail Page Layout

**Tasks:**

1.  Create layout for `CampaignDetailPage` with sections (mock data):
    -   **Header:** Address, creator, status badge
    -   **Stats:** Goal, deadline, total raised, progress bar
    -   **Contribute Section:**
        -   Input for contribution amount
        -   Display calculated token reward

    -   **Contributor Actions:**
        -   "Request Refund" button (show if failed)
2.  Use conditional rendering to show/hide sections based on role
3.  Add a countdown timer (mock or real using `date-fns`)

**Research Topics:**

-   Conditional rendering patterns
-   Countdown timers with `setInterval`
-   Tailwind grid layouts

**Deliverables:**

-   Polished campaign detail page
-   All sections visible (we'll add conditional logic later)
-   A working countdown to a future date

* * * * *

#### Step 2.6: Polish & Review

**Tasks:**

1.  Add loading states (skeleton screens or spinners)
2.  Add "empty states" (e.g., "No campaigns yet" on homepage)
3.  Make responsive (mobile + desktop)
4.  Add hover effects, transitions

**Research Topics:**

-   Skeleton loaders
-   Responsive design with Tailwind
-   Accessibility basics (semantic HTML, keyboard nav)

**Deliverables:**

-   Fully styled, responsive static UI
-   Works on mobile screen size
-   We review together - I'll give UX feedback

**Phase 2 Complete! 🎉**\
*You now have a professional-looking UI. In Phase 3, we connect to the blockchain.*

* * * * *

🔌 Phase 3: Wallet Connection
-----------------------------

**Duration:** 3-5 days\
**Goal:** Connect MetaMask and display user's account & network

### What You'll Learn

-   Web3 providers and signers
-   wagmi + RainbowKit setup
-   Network management
-   React Context for wallet state

### Steps to Complete

#### Step 3.1: Install wagmi + RainbowKit

**Why wagmi:** It handles 90% of wallet complexity. Don't reinvent the wheel!

**Tasks:**

1.  Install wagmi, viem, RainbowKit, and dependencies
2.  Follow RainbowKit setup guide:
    -   Wrap your app in `WagmiConfig` and `RainbowKitProvider`
    -   Configure for Sepolia testnet
    -   Add supported wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
3.  Replace your placeholder "Connect Wallet" button with `<ConnectButton />`
4.  Test connection with MetaMask

**Research Topics:**

-   What is a Web3 provider?
-   What is a signer?
-   EIP-1193 (wallet communication standard)
-   wagmi vs ethers.js (understand the abstraction layers)

**Deliverables:**

-   Screenshot of wallet connection modal
-   Connected account displayed in header
-   Explain: What's the difference between a provider and a signer?

* * * * *

#### Step 3.2: Use wagmi Hooks Throughout Your App

**Important Note:** With modern wagmi + RainbowKit, you DON'T need to create a custom WalletContext! The `<WagmiProvider>` you added in Step 3.1 already makes wallet state available everywhere.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Learn wagmi hooks** - These work in ANY component without additional setup:
    -   `useAccount()` - Get connected address, connection status, chain info
    -   `useBalance()` - Get ETH balance for any address
    -   `useChainId()` - Get current chain ID
    -   Import them directly: `import { useAccount, useBalance } from 'wagmi'`

2.  **Add network detection** to your app:
    -   Use `useAccount()` to get current chain
    -   Check if `chain?.id !== sepolia.id` (11155111)
    -   Show a warning banner: "?? Wrong Network - Please switch to Sepolia"

3.  **Optional: Display more info in header** (beyond what RainbowKit shows):
    -   ENS name (if available): `useEnsName({ address })`
    -   Custom balance display
    -   User's campaign count

**Research Topics:**

-   wagmi hook composition (using multiple hooks together)
-   Chain IDs (Sepolia = 11155111)
-   Why wagmi hooks are globally available (hint: Context under the hood, but you don't manage it!)

**Deliverables:**

-   Network warning banner appears when connected to wrong chain
-   Demo: Connect to Mainnet ? See warning ? Switch to Sepolia ? Warning disappears
-   Explain: "Why don't we need to create a custom WalletContext when wagmi already provides one?"
#### Step 3.3: Add Network Switching

**Tasks:**

1.  Use `useSwitchChain()` hook from wagmi (modern API, replaces old `useSwitchNetwork`):
    ```javascript
    import { useSwitchChain } from 'wagmi';
    import { sepolia } from 'wagmi/chains';
    
    const { switchChain } = useSwitchChain();
    ```
2.  Add a "Switch to Sepolia" button in the network warning banner
3.  On click, call: `switchChain({ chainId: sepolia.id })`
4.  Test with MetaMask - it should prompt you to switch networks

**Research Topics:**

-   EIP-3326 (wallet_switchEthereumChain)
-   Programmatic network switching
-   wagmi v2 API changes (useSwitchChain vs old useSwitchNetwork)

**Deliverables:**

-   "Switch to Sepolia" button that triggers MetaMask network switch
-   Screenshot of MetaMask prompt
-   Test: Connect to Mainnet → Click switch button → Approve in MetaMask → See banner disappear

* * * * *

#### Step 3.4: Conditional UI Based on Wallet State

**Tasks:**

1.  On `CreateCampaignPage` and `MyCampaignsPage`:
    -   If wallet not connected → Show "Connect wallet to continue"
    -   If connected → Show content
2.  On `CampaignDetailPage`:
    -   Compare connected address with campaign creator
    -   Show creator-only buttons only if match
    -   Show "Connect wallet to contribute" if not connected
3.  Test all scenarios:
    -   Not connected
    -   Connected, wrong network
    -   Connected, correct network

**Deliverables:**

-   All pages handle wallet states gracefully
-   Screenshots of each state
-   Question: Why do we check wallet state in the UI if the contract will check too?

**Phase 3 Complete! 🎉**\
*You're now connected to the blockchain. Time to READ contract data.*

* * * * *

📖 Phase 4: Reading Contract Data
---------------------------------

**Duration:** 1-1.5 weeks\
**Goal:** Fetch and display real campaign data from your deployed contracts

### What You'll Learn

-   ABIs (the contract's API)
-   Contract read operations
-   React hooks for async Web3 calls
-   Error handling

### Good News: View Functions Already Implemented! ✅

**Your current contracts already include comprehensive view functions:**

-   `getCompaignDetails()` - Returns all campaign data in one call (creator, goal, deadline, totalRaised, state, withdrawn, rewardPerEth)
-   `getContributionOf(address)` - Returns individual contribution amount
-   Status helpers: `isActive()`, `hasEnded()`, `isSuccessful()`, `isFailed()`
-   Individual getters: `getCreator()`, `getGoal()`, `getDeadline()`, `getTotalRaised()`, `getState()`
-   `getRecommendedAllowance()` - Calculates required token approval for factory admin

**This means we can skip straight to using them in the frontend!**

* * * * *

#### Step 4.1: Understand Your Contract's View Functions

**Tasks:**

1.  Read your deployed MasterContract on Etherscan
2.  Call each view function manually to understand the return values:
    -   `getCompaignDetails()` - Note the order of return values: (creator, goal, deadline, totalRaised, state, withdrawn, rewardPerEth)
    -   `getContributionOf(yourAddress)` - Check your contribution
    -   `isActive()`, `hasEnded()` - Test status helpers
    -   `getRecommendedAllowance()` - Understand the calculation
3.  Document the return types (especially the State enum: 0=Funding, 1=Successful, 2=Failed, 3=Withdrawn)

**Research Topics:**

-   Solidity multiple return values (tuples)
-   How enums serialize to integers in ABI calls
-   Why one function call is better than seven separate calls

**Deliverables:**

-   Etherscan screenshots showing view function outputs
-   Notes on return value structure for `getCompaignDetails()`
-   Answer: "Why is `getCompaignDetails()` better than calling 7 separate getter functions?"

* * * * *

**Tasks:**

1.  After compilation, Hardhat creates ABIs in `artifacts/` folder
2.  Copy ABIs to your React project:
    -   Create `src/contracts/` folder
    -   Copy `CampaignProxyFactory.json` and `CrowdFundingMaster.json`
    -   Extract just the `abi` field (you don't need full artifact)
3.  Create `src/contracts/config.js`:

**Research Topics:**

-   What is an ABI?
-   Why does the frontend need it?
-   How does the ABI encode function calls?

**Deliverables:**

-   ABIs in frontend project
-   Config file with contract addresses
-   Question: What would happen if the ABI doesn't match the deployed contract?

* * * * *

#### Step 4.3: Read Campaign List from Factory

**Tasks:**

1.  On `HomePage`, use wagmi's `useContractRead`:
2.  Display the array of addresses
3.  Add error handling (what if read fails?)
4.  Add loading state

**Research Topics:**

-   wagmi `useContractRead` hook
-   Why reads don't cost gas
-   RPC calls under the hood

**Deliverables:**

-   Homepage displays real campaign addresses from your deployed factory
-   Loading spinner while fetching
-   Error message if RPC fails
-   Explain: Where is this data coming from? (hint: RPC node)

* * * * *

#### Step 4.4: Read Campaign Details for Each Card

**Tasks:**

1.  For each campaign address, call `getCompaignDetails()` (note: contract spells it "Compaign")
2.  Create a custom hook `useCampaignDetails(address)`:
3.  Use this hook in `CampaignCard` component
4.  Replace mock data with real data
5.  Handle the State enum (0 = Funding, 1 = Successful, 2 = Failed, 3 = Withdrawn)

**Research Topics:**

-   Custom React hooks
-   Solidity enums (how they serialize)
-   BigNumber handling (goal, totalRaised are BigNumbers)

**Deliverables:**

-   Homepage shows REAL campaigns with REAL data
-   Status badges reflect actual contract state
-   Progress bar shows actual totalRaised/goal
-   Code review: I'll check how you handle BigNumber conversion

* * * * *

#### Step 4.5: Campaign Detail Page Data

**Tasks:**

1.  Get `address` from URL using `useParams()`
2.  Call `getCompaignDetails()` (note: contract spells it "Compaign") for this campaign
3.  If wallet connected, call `getContributionOf(userAddress)`
4.  Display all data on detail page:
    -   Convert wei to ETH for display (use `formatEther`)
    -   Show deadline as readable date
    -   Show countdown if still active
    -   Show user's contribution amount
5.  Calculate and show token reward for contribution input:

**Research Topics:**

-   ethers.js `formatEther` and `parseEther`
-   BigNumber math (multiply, divide)
-   Fetching ERC20 decimals

**Deliverables:**

-   Detail page shows all real data from `getCompaignDetails()`
-   Contribution calculator shows correct token reward
-   Question: If rewardPerEth is 100, and I contribute 0.5 ETH, how many tokens do I get? (Answer: 50 tokens)
-   Explain: Why does the contract use `(msg.value * 10^18 * rewardRate) / 1 ether`?

* * * * *

#### Step 4.6: My Campaigns Page

**Tasks:**

1.  Call `getCampaignsOf(userAddress)` (note: correct spelling here) from factory
2.  Display campaigns created by connected user
3.  If no campaigns, show "You haven't created any campaigns yet"
4.  Add "Create Your First Campaign" link

**Deliverables:**

-   Page shows campaigns you created
-   Different user sees different campaigns
-   Empty state looks good

* * * * *

#### Step 4.7: Display Token Info

**Tasks:**

1.  For a campaign, read the token address
2.  Create `useTokenInfo(tokenAddress)` hook:
    -   Reads `name()`, `symbol()`, `decimals()` from ERC20
    -   Use standard ERC20 ABI
3.  Display: "Rewards: 100 TOKEN per ETH"
4.  Handle token decimal properly in reward calculations

**Research Topics:**

-   ERC20 standard interface
-   Token decimals (why they exist)

**Deliverables:**

-   Campaign shows token symbol (e.g., "TEST")
-   Reward calculations respect decimals
-   Explain: If a token has 6 decimals instead of 18, how does that change the display?

**Phase 4 Complete! 🎉**\
*You can now READ the entire blockchain state. Next: WRITE to it.*

* * * * *

✍️ Phase 5: Writing Transactions
--------------------------------

**Duration:** 2-3 weeks (this is the CORE phase)\
**Goal:** Execute all contract interactions: create, approve, contribute, finalize, withdraw, refund

### What You'll Learn

-   Transaction lifecycle
-   Gas estimation
-   Error handling (revert reasons)
-   User confirmation flows
-   State management during async operations
-   **The token approval UX challenge!**

* * * * *

### Step 5.1: Transaction UI Pattern

**Before writing specific transactions, create a reusable pattern.**

**Tasks:**

1.  Create `TransactionButton` component that handles:
    -   Click → "Waiting for wallet confirmation" state
    -   After confirmation → "Transaction pending..." (show tx hash)
    -   After 1 confirmation → "Success!" (show checkmark)
    -   Error → Show error message
2.  Install `react-hot-toast` for notifications
3.  Test with a mock async function

**Research Topics:**

-   Transaction states: idle → preparing → wallet confirmation → pending → confirmed → error
-   wagmi `useContractWrite` and `useWaitForTransaction`
-   UX patterns for blockchain transactions

**Deliverables:**

-   Reusable transaction button component
-   Toast notifications on success/error
-   Demo video showing all states

* * * * *

### Step 5.2: Create Campaign Transaction

**Tasks:**

1.  On `CreateCampaignPage`, use `useContractWrite`:
2.  On form submit:
    -   Convert ETH to wei (`parseEther`)
    -   Convert days to seconds
    -   Validate token address format
    -   Call `createClone(goal, duration, tokensPerEth, tokenAddress)`
3.  Wait for transaction confirmation using `useWaitForTransaction`
4.  Parse `CompaignCreated` event from receipt to get new campaign address:
    -   Use `receipt.logs` and `decodeEventLog` from viem
5.  Redirect to `/campaign/{newAddress}`
6.  Show success message

**Research Topics:**

-   Parsing event logs from transaction receipts
-   wagmi transaction hooks
-   Form submission handling

**Deliverables:**

-   Working campaign creation flow
-   New campaign appears in list immediately after creation
-   Video: Create campaign → Wait → Redirect → See it live
-   Question: Why do we need to parse the event instead of just knowing the address?

**Common Errors to Debug:**

-   "Gas estimation failed" → What does this mean?
-   Transaction reverts → Check constructor requirements

* * * * *

### Step 5.3: Token Approval - Factory Admin Flow

**Understanding Your Contract Architecture:**

Your contracts use **centralized token distribution** where:
-   Factory deployer (admin) holds ALL reward tokens
-   Admin approves Factory contract once for all campaigns
-   Campaigns call `factory.distributeTokens()` to reward contributors
-   **Campaign creators don't need to approve anything!**

**Tasks:**

1.  **Create Admin Dashboard** (`/admin` route - factory deployer only):
    -   Check if user is factory admin: `factory.adminAddress()`
    -   Read allowance: `token.allowance(adminAddress, factoryAddress)`
    -   Calculate recommended allowance (sum of all active campaigns' potential rewards)
    -   Display status: ✅ Sufficient / ⚠️ Low / ❌ Critical
    -   "Approve" button to call `token.approve(factoryAddress, amount)`
    
2.  **Update Campaign Pages** (public users):
    -   Remove per-campaign approval UI (not needed!)
    -   Show: "Rewards distributed by platform"
    -   For creators: "No token approval needed from you!"
    
3.  **Error Handling:**
    -   If contribution fails with "insufficient allowance"
    -   Show: "Platform token distribution not configured. Contact support."

**Research Topics:**

-   ERC20 approve/allowance pattern
-   Centralized vs decentralized token distribution
-   Trade-offs: simplicity vs decentralization

**Deliverables:**

-   Admin dashboard showing factory allowance status
-   Campaign pages show platform-managed rewards messaging
-   Test scenario:
    1. Admin approves factory for sufficient tokens
    2. Create campaign (as different user, no approval needed)
    3. Contribute successfully, receive tokens
    4. Reduce factory allowance to 0 → Contribution fails with clear error
-   Answer: "Why does your architecture use centralized token distribution? What are the trade-offs?"

* * * * *

### Step 5.4: Contribute Transaction

**Tasks:**

1.  On campaign detail page, contribute section:

    -   Input for amount (in ETH)
    -   Live calculation of token reward
    -   Check if allowance sufficient (if not, show warning)
    -   "Contribute" button
2.  Implement contribution:

    -   This is a PAYABLE function - send ETH with it:
    -   After success:
        -   Show success message with token reward
        -   Refetch campaign data (totalRaised updated)
        -   Refetch user contribution
3.  Add validations:

    -   Amount > 0
    -   Amount <= user's balance
    -   Deadline not passed
    -   Campaign state = Funding
4.  Handle errors gracefully:

    -   "Insufficient allowance" → Explain and link to approval
    -   "Deadline passed" → Show message
    -   Generic errors → Show revert reason

**Research Topics:**

-   Payable functions
-   Sending value with transactions
-   Transaction error handling

**Deliverables:**

-   Working contribution flow
-   User ETH and token balances update in real-time
-   Token reward calculation matches contract formula
-   Error handling for all cases
-   Test scenarios:
    1. Contribute small amount → state stays Funding
    2. Contribute exact remaining amount → state auto-changes to Successful
    3. Try contributing as creator → See error
    4. Verify token rewards received after contribution
-   Question: What happens to your ETH after you contribute? Where do the tokens come from?

* * * * *

### Step 5.5: Finalize Transaction

**Tasks:**

1.  Add "Finalize" button on campaign detail (visible to everyone if deadline passed)
2.  Check if deadline has passed (client-side and contract-side)
3.  Call `finalize()`
4.  After success, refetch campaign state (should change to Successful or Failed)
5.  Update UI to reflect new state

**Research Topics:**

-   Why finalize is needed (state transitions)
-   Who can call finalize? (anyone!)
-   What determines success vs failure?

**Deliverables:**

-   Finalize button appears after deadline (or shows "Already finalized" if not Funding)
-   State changes correctly when finalize is called
-   Different UI for successful vs failed campaigns
-   Test scenarios:
    1. Campaign reaches goal during contribution → Skip finalize, go straight to withdraw
    2. Campaign deadline passes while Funding → Finalize required
-   Explain: "Why does the contract support both auto-finalization and manual finalization?"

* * * * *

### Step 5.6: Withdraw Transaction (Creator)

**Tasks:**

1.  Add "Withdraw" button (creator only, successful campaigns only)
2.  Check conditions:
    -   Connected wallet === creator
    -   State === Successful
    -   Not already withdrawn
3.  Call `withdraw()`
4.  After success, show withdrawn badge
5.  Creator's ETH balance should increase

**Research Topics:**

-   Access control in UI vs contract
-   Why check conditions in UI if contract checks too? (UX!)

**Deliverables:**

-   Working withdraw flow
-   Video: Full successful campaign flow (create → contribute → finalize → withdraw)

* * * * *

### Step 5.7: Refund Transaction (Contributors)

**Tasks:**

1.  Add "Refund" button (contributors only, failed campaigns only)
2.  Check conditions:
    -   User has contributions > 0
    -   State === Failed
    -   Deadline passed
3.  Call `refund()`
4.  After success, user's contribution should be 0
5.  User's ETH balance should increase by their contribution

**Deliverables:**

-   Working refund flow
-   Test scenario: Create campaign with high goal → contribute small amount → wait for deadline → finalize → refund

* * * * *

### Step 5.8: Transaction History & Notifications

**Tasks:**

1.  Store recent transactions in local state or localStorage:
    -   "Created campaign X"
    -   "Contributed 0.5 ETH to campaign Y"
    -   etc.
2.  Show notification bell in header with count
3.  Click to see recent activity
4.  Link to Etherscan for each transaction

**Research Topics:**

-   localStorage for persistence
-   Notification UX patterns

**Deliverables:**

#### Step 6.1: Proper Token Decimal Handling

**The Problem:**\
Not all tokens have 18 decimals. Your reward calculations might be wrong!

**Tasks:**

1.  Fetch `decimals()` from reward token
2.  Update reward calculation to respect decimals:
3.  Test with a 6-decimal token and an 18-decimal token
4.  Create `formatTokenAmount(amount, decimals)` utility

**Deliverables:**

-   Correct display for any token decimal
-   Explain: Why do different tokens have different decimals?

* * * * *

    -   Shows: "3 days, 5 hours, 12 minutes" until deadline
    -   Updates every second
    -   After deadline, shows "Ended"
2.  Auto-refresh campaign data when deadline passes:
    -   Use `setInterval` to check
    -   When countdown hits 0, refetch campaign state
    -   Show "Finalize now" button

**Research Topics:**

-   React `useEffect` cleanup (prevent memory leaks)
-   Interval-based updates

**Deliverables:**

-   Live countdown on detail page
-   Auto-updates when deadline passes

* * * * *

#### Step 6.3: Campaign Status Logic

**Tasks:**

1.  Create `getCampaignStatus(summary)` utility that returns:
    -   "Funding" - before deadline, goal not met
    -   "Successful" - goal met (regardless of deadline)
    -   "Failed" - deadline passed, goal not met, finalized
    -   "Withdrawn" - successful and withdrawn
    -   "Funding Ended" - deadline passed but not finalized yet
2.  Use consistent status across all pages
3.  Color-code badges (green = successful, red = failed, yellow = funding, gray = withdrawn)

**Deliverables:**

-   Consistent status display
-   Clear visual distinction

* * * * *

#### Step 6.4: Error Message Improvements

**Tasks:**

1.  Create error message mapper:

-   No raw revert strings shown to users

* * * * *

#### Step 6.5: Loading States & Skeletons

**Tasks:**

1.  Add skeleton loaders for:
    -   Campaign cards while loading
    -   Campaign detail page while loading
2.  Add spinners during transactions
3.  Disable buttons during loading
4.  Show "Refreshing..." indicator when refetching data

**Research Topics:**

-   Skeleton UI patterns
-   Optimistic UI updates

**Deliverables:**

-   Professional loading experience
-   No sudden content shifts

* * * * *

#### Step 6.6: Mobile Responsiveness

**Tasks:**

1.  Test on mobile (use Chrome DevTools device emulation)
2.  Fix layout issues:
    -   Stack cards vertically on mobile
    -   Make forms full-width
    -   Adjust header for mobile
3.  Test wallet connection on mobile (use WalletConnect)

**Deliverables:**

-   Works perfectly on phone
-   Screenshots on mobile

* * * * *

#### Step 6.7: Accessibility

**Tasks:**

1.  Add proper HTML semantics (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`)
2.  Add `aria-label` to buttons
3.  Test keyboard navigation (Tab through all interactive elements)
4.  Add focus indicators
5.  Test with screen reader (optional but valuable)

**Research Topics:**
